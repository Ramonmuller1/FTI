Não faço ideia do que estou fazendo.
Odeio o GitHub, é muito confuso.


So I must leave, I'll have to go

To Las Vegas or Monaco

And win a fortune in a game

My life will never be the same


Money, money, money

Must be funny

In the rich man's world

Money, money, money

Always sunny

In the rich man's world


A-ha, ah, ah

All the things I could do

If I had a little money

It's a rich man's world


Money, money, money

Must be funny

In the rich man's world

Money, money, money

Always sunny

In the rich man's world


A-ha, ah, ah

All the things I could do

If I had a little money

It's a rich man's world


It's a rich man's world
